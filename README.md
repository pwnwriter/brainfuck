<h2 align="center">The ðŸ§  Fvck Interpreter</h2>


<p align="center">A pretty tiny interpreter for the programming language brainfuck</p>

The goal of this project is to implement a simple interpreter
for brainfuck using features built into C.
## installation
Installation can be done by using `makefile` as follows.
 
 ```sh
 $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/pwnwriter/brainfuck.git
 $ cd brainfuck
 $ make
 $ sudo/doas make install
 ```
You can test the interpreter by running
```sh
$ make test 
```
inside `brainfuck` directory.<br>
it should show `It works!`

If you want to help then you can make the interpreter more advanced, i would love to accept your PR's;)
